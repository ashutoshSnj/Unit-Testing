# NestJS Testing Journey ðŸš€

In this project, I started testing from the **service layer**, then moved to the **controller** using mocks.  
After that, I added **guards** and tested them, including a **custom decorator** used inside the guard.  
Next, I worked on **interceptors** and wrote their tests.  
I also created and tested **custom pipes**.  
Finally, I tested **async methods** to complete the flow.
